Splunk Enterprise:
	localhost:8000
	bobpeep

	Settings > Forwarding and Receiving > Add new > port 9997
	Settings > Indexes > New Index > "Zeek"


NOTE: I put Zeek and SplunkForwarder on a Ubuntu VM.  The VM is running on my Windows 10 Laptop which has Splunk Enterprise installed on it.

Configure Zeek:
	go to /usr/local/zeek/etc
	You will see node.cfg, networks.cfg, and zeekctl.cfg
	Leave zeekctl.cfg as is.
	
	In networks.cfg, put the subnets you will monitor:
		192.168.86.0/24 Private IP space

	In node.cfg, you are setting where the loggers are.  Set up this file like this:

		[logger-1]
		type=logger
		host=localhost
		#
		[manager]
		type=manager
		host=localhost
		#
		[proxy-1]
		type=proxy
		host=localhost
		#
		[worker-1]
		type=worker
		host=localhost
		interface=ens33

	Everything else should be commented out.  ens33 is the interface of my VM.  Find out what yours is by doing ifconfig/ipconfig.
	localhost is referring to the VM I have Zeek installed on.
	
	Change logs to JSON format - go to /usr/local/zeek/share/zeek/site/local.zeek and add the following line:
		#output to JSON
		@load policy/tuning/json-logs.zeek

	To start the Zeek, go to /usr/local/zeek/bin and run the zeekctl.  I do it with:
		sudo ./zeekctl

	It should start the command line for Zeek.  Use "Start" to start, "Stop" to stop Zeek, and "Deploy" to apply the changes you've made.
	After using a command, use "Status" to see the status of Zeek and make sure it's running properly.
	Use "Quit" to exit out of Zeek's command line.  Zeek will still be running when you exit.
	Use "Help" to see other commands.
	"Restart" is a command too I think.

	You can view Zeek's logs in /usr/local/zeek/logs.
	Generate some logs by going to a website or something with the machine/VM your Zeek is installed on.
	

Configure SplunkForwarder:
	To install SplunkForwarder, I downloaded a .deb file of SplunkForwarder and had to use dpkg to install SplunkForwarder, if I remember right.
	I think the command was something like dpkg -i FileNameOf.deb.  If this doesn't work, use dpkg -help or something like that.  Find the -i command.	

	Assuming you've installed SplunkForwarder, you can probably find it in /opt/splunkforwarder.

	Go to /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local.  You will see inputs.conf, outputs.conf, README, and server.conf.
	If you don't see outputs.conf and inputs.conf, create two files of the same name.  I think when I first installed, I didn't have those two.

	outputs.conf is where SplunkForwarder will forward the logs to.  Set it up with the IP address of your machine running Splunk Enterprise.  Copy and paste the lines between the =====.

	inputs.conf is basically the paths to the Zeek logs that will be forwarded to Splunk Enterprise.  Copy and paste the lines between the ====.

	Go to /opt/splunkforwarder/bin
	If this is your first time running splunkforwarder, I think use this command:
		sudo ./splunk start --accept-license

	I think you will create a user and password.

	Otherwise, use this command to start it:
		sudo ./splunk start

	Make your username whatever you want.  Mine is -username: admsplunk

	Use this command to see if SplunkForwarder is running:
		sudo ./splunk status

	Use this command to see if SplunkForwarder is forwarding to Splunk Enterprise:
		sudo ./splunk list forward-server

	If it shows configured, but inactive, keep in mind the IP address of the computer where Splunk Enterprise is installed.  Your home network may change your IP address every once in a while as you turn on and off devices.
	Also, if you think you have everything configured correctly but it still doesn't work, try allowing traffic through port 9997 on your firewall.
	I did that on my windows laptop because I was troubleshooting, but that was before I figured out I didn't have my outputs.conf correct.

	If everthing is configured correctly on your zeek/splunkforwarder VM/machine, when you do 
		sudo ./splunk status

	you will see Active Forwards:  192.168.86.217:9997 or whatever your Splunk Enterprise machine's IP address is.

	Go to your Splunk Enterprise.
	Click on Search
	In the Search bar put: index=zeek

	Hopefully, you'll see a whole bunch of logs.
